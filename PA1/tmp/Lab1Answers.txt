Question 1 

	What are the advantages and disadvantages of each of the two scheduling policies? Also, give the advantages and disadvantages of the round robin scheduling policy originally implemented in Xinu.

Answer - 

Advantage of Exponential Distriution like Scheduling policy
	> Its simple in implementation.
	> Process with low priroty also get scheduled equally. 
	> It prevents CPU to get in to starvation.
	> Faster processing time

Disadvantage of Exponential Distriution like Scheduling policy
	> All process are not  equally scheduled.
	> Rely on random values, until it comes to desired value, Process can't be scheduled.
	

Advantage of Linuxlike Scheduling policy
	> As priority values changes at each epoch, Fairness across processes is ensured.
	> Process with lower priority get fair chance in next epochs.
	> Highest Priority process will be completed first.

Disadvantage of Linuxlike Scheduling policy
	> Complex implementation.
	> High Time and space complexity

Advantage of Xinu like round robin Scheduling policy
	> Its simple in implementation.
	> Higher priority processes scheduled first.

Disadvantage of Xinu like round robin Scheduling policy
	> Starvation for lowest priority processes.
	> Lower the Time Slice for process execution, higher the context switching which results in slowing down the performance.

Question 2 - 
	Describe the way each of the schedulers affects the NULL process.

Answer - 
	Exponential like scheduler - If ther is no process at queue head i.e. readyhead, NULLPROC is scheduled.
	Linux like scheduler	   - NULPROCC not scheduled.
	Round Robin like scheduler - NULPROCC not scheduled.
